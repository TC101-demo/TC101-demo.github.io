# Submit a new item to our listing
*🛈 Currently, we only offer the option to submit new datasets.*
*We will soon support the possibility to submit tools.*

🛈 If you want to **fix a dataset or any other page**, please suggest changes on GitHub using the <a class="btn btn-default" role="button" href="{{ site.github_edit_base_url }}/{{ page.path }}"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></span> Edit this page</a> link on top of each page.
You can also [submit new issues](https://github.com/TC101-demo/TC101-demo.github.io/issues/new/choose) to report any problem, and of course you can review and suggest changes for [any part of the code used to generate this website](https://github.com/TC101-demo/TC101-demo.github.io).


## Submission options
There are several ways to submit a new item to be included in our listing, as summarized below.  
Please note that **you do not need to be the author of a dataset to submit it**: every contribution is welcome to make this listing as exhaustive and useful as possible.

1. **[Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub](#1-create-a-pull-request-on-github)**  
   This is the fastest option to publish a dataset, but it required familiarity with GitHub PR workflow (and a GitHub account).
2. **[Create an Issue on GitHub](#2-create-an-issue-on-github)**  
   This is a fast option which does not require extensive GitHub mastery, by it still requires a GitHub account and will put more work in curators' hands.
3. **[Fill our online form](#3-fill-our-online-form)** **FIXME do we have a reliable solution for this? (with support for thumbnail upload)**  
   This option is fairly simple as you just need to answer questions. Processing time will be longer though.
4. **[Email dataset curators](#4-email-dataset-curators) at `tc101-demo(at)@googlegroups.com`**  
   This is probably the simplest option, but also the one which require more work from curators; it may take a week to complete the publishing.

The detailed procedure for each option is detailed in the rest of this page.
