# Welcome to the IAPR TC10/11 Resource Website

**This is a demo website, not intended for production yet!**

IAPR TC10/11 are the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) Technical Committees Number 10 and 11. 
On the one hand, IAPR TC10 promotes interaction among researchers working in document image analysis in general, and graphics recognition in particular.
On the other hand, IAPR TC11 is concerned with the theory and applications of Reading Systems. 
Both technical Committees have join forces to provide a library of resources,
i.e. Datasets, Software, Tools etc. for researchers on the fields of graphics
recognition and reading systems. We believe that the overlap between these two
communities can be exploited to push the research in these amazing topics.
