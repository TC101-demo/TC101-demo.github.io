# A prototype from IAPR TC10 and TC11
This website is built as a proof-of-concept to assess the opportunity to move from the [current platform](http://tc11.cvc.uab.es/) to a statically generated website hosted on GitHub Pages.
Please read our [dedicated post]({% link _news/2021-09-05-proto-ready.md %}) for more details about our motivations.

Contributors from this project include, for now, [Joseph Chazalon](https://github.com/jchazalon), [Pau Riba](https://github.com/priba) and [Muzzamil Luqman](https://github.com/mmluqman).

<mark>We welcome contributors</mark> to work on this experiment: please [get in touch with us]({% link _pages/feedback.html %}) to join our team!
