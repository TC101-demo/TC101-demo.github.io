This is a test to assess whether the IAPR TC10/11 can use GitHub pages as a feature-full and reliable hosting service.

The website is built automatically every time someone makes a change on source files and commits them. It takes 30 for the online version to be updated.

It means that, provided you have a GitHub account authorized to make changes to the associated repository, you can:

1. click on the pen icon on top right,
2. make changes
3. save/commit

and the website is automatically updated.

There is no hosting fees, no limits on the number of collaborators, and a great potential for automation.
Also, anyone can suggest changes, and managers can review and eventually accept them with a couple of clicks.
